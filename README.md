❤️ **This library is developed and maintained by MonOrdo** ❤️

This library is developed to use the [Bit field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_field) method as the main logic base within our permission system. We did not invent this method, nor its application to the permission system, but after having been inspired by discord, for example. We chose to simplify its use by creating a library to apply it more simply. This library supports [injection](https://rxjs.dev/) within a module and can therefore be injected, for example, within the services of a [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) server. This library also exposes a Guard to simplify its use within [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/).
